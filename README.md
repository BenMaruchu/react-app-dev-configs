### Configurations

##### Committing codes

This repo use [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) which helps to ensure consistency on how contributors writes commit messages.

To ensure commit message rules are followed there is a [commint linter](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) which is run to validate commit message before commiting your codes into the repo.

Based on configs you can commit using `npm scripts` by execute `yarn commit` or `npm run commit` to commit staged changes or normal `git commit` command, but either way your commit messages will be linted.

If you want to stage and commit all changed files you can do that by `yarn commit:all` or `npm run commit:all`.

##### Linting codes

This project extends create-react-app eslint rules and add more rules which can be viewed on .eslintrc file.

##### Linting JSDocs

On documenting code functions and code using JSDocs, there are rules configured on what properties to be included while documenting a piece of code using JSDoc. Read more [eslint-plugin-jsdoc](https://github.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc)

##### Formating codes

For code formating [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) have been configured in this repo.

##### Generating release changelog

Changelog for releases can generated by running `yarn changelog` or `npm run changelog` which will update `CHANGELOG.md` file by extracting changes from commit messages.
